About
=====

This program is an interpreter for the REC (record) programming language.
It is a solution for the PhD qualification [exam](http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~nicolosi/quals/pl-f12.pdf) on Programming Languages
at Stevens Institute of Technology as posed by Adriana Compagnoni
in the Fall of 2012.
This program is based on code from the book "Essentials of Programming
Languages" by Friedman and Wand, The MIT Press, 3rd edition.

Test Cases
==========

You can run the code in DrRacket.
The test cases are based on the cases from the [exam](http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~nicolosi/quals/pl-f12.pdf).
They constitute examples on how to use the interpreter.
